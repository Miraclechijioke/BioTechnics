# BioTechnics

BioTechnics is an AR-based web platform where students from any background can visit and learn various concepts in biology with the help of 3D Models, which can aid in easier and faster understanding. BioTechnics focuses on full visualization and imersion of biological science concepts.

## Short Description

We all know how tough it is to understand the complex and difficult topics in biology. BioTechnics is an AR-based web platform where students can freely access to learn about various biological science concepts and have fun while at it. Learning has been made simpler with the help of interactive 3D Models and AR. BioTechnics can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter. We have built the site using React Js, Three Js, Auth0.

## 💡 Inspiration

We all know how tough it is to understand the complex and difficult topics in biology. And a lot of the time both physical and online classes can be quite monotonous, the concepts taught are not retrainable. The practical and visual aspects are the most important for subjects like biology, which require physical practice and visualization.

## 💻 What it does

BioTechnics is an AR-based web platform where students can freely access to learn about various biological science concepts. Learning is made simpler with the help of interactive 3D Models and AR. BioTechnics can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter.

## 🔨 How we built it

- React Js: For the frontend
- Auth0: For user authentication
- Three Js: For rendering 3D Models

## Best Use of Auth0

- We have used Auth0 for secure user authentication

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

Rendering the 3D Model and AR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project under the given time frame

## 📖 What we learned

- Using Three js for rendering 3D Models
